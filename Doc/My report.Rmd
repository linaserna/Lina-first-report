# When you click the **GJÃ–OGJAGJLKANGLKAJGKNH** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# ggjnkgnkjangkgkabg

library(tidyverse)

```{r cars, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
